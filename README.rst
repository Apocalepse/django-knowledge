Welcome to Django Knowledge!
============================

Django Knowledge makes it easy to add an integrated help desk or knowledge base to your 
Django project with only a few lines of boilerplate code. However, you should just as 
easily be able to customize the looks and feel of the app.

**django-knowledge** was developed internally for `Zapier <https://zapier.com/>`_.


At a glance:
------------

- Turn common questions or support requests into a **knowledge base**.
- Control who sees what with simple view statuses: *public*, *private*, or *internal*.
- Assign questions and answers to **categories** for easy sorting.
- Staff get **moderation controls** or they can use the familiar *Django admin* to handle support requests.
- Included base **templates and design** with prebundled HTML and CSS.

  custom header and footer.
